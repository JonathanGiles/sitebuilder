# Site Builder

Site Builder is a simple static website generator / templating engine, used primarily (at this stage) to generate [JonathanGiles.net](http://www.jonathangiles.net). You can see how Site Builder is used to generate JonathanGiles.net by [browsing the GitHub repo](https://github.com/jonathangiles/jonathangiles.net) containing everything required to generate JonathanGiles.net.
